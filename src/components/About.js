    <div>It’s never been easier than ever to view the galaxy from earth. With little to no light pollution, the views from certified IDA Dark Sky Parks are spectacular, magical, and breath-taking.  Most of these magnificent parks’ lands are reserved and open only at night when the sun goes down and the night takes over to give us a glimpse of the mystical stars that surround us. Residents in these areas maintain and uphold their local park certifications by limiting their usage of lights and energy to preserve the natural night skies. Support these local areas and parks by camping out with your family and friends year round. </div>
